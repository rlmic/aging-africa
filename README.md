# **Project Name: Urbanization and Health Outcomes Analysis**

This project investigates the impact of urbanization on health outcomes. It includes data cleaning, statistical analysis, and data visualization to explore how urbanization correlates with health indicators across different regions. The analysis is performed using R, with dependencies managed using `renv` for environment reproducibility.

## **Project Overview**

This project analyzes the relationship between urbanization and health outcomes using a dataset from the World Health Organization (WHO). We aim to answer the following research questions:

- How does urbanization affect health outcomes such as life expectancy and disease prevalence?
- Are there regional disparities in health outcomes due to urbanization?

### **Key Features:**
- Data preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the health data.
- Statistical analysis: Using linear regression models to assess the relationship between urbanization and health outcomes.
- Data visualization: Generating plots to visualize trends in the data.
- Output: The analysis results and visualizations are stored in the `output/` folder.

## **Installation Instructions**

### Step 1: Install R
If you don't have R installed, download it from the official CRAN website: [CRAN R Project](https://cran.r-project.org/)

### Step 2: Install RStudio (optional but recommended)
RStudio provides an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. Download it from [RStudio Download](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

### Step 3: Install Project Dependencies
This project uses the `renv` package to manage dependencies. Follow these steps to set up the project environment:

1. Install `renv` if you havenâ€™t already:
   ```r
   install.packages("renv")
   ```

2. Restore the environment by running:
   ```r
   renv::restore()
   ```

This will automatically install all required packages as specified in the `renv.lock` file.

---

## **Project Setup**

To set up the project, clone the repository and set up the required environment:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/urbanization-health-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd urbanization-health-analysis
   ```

3. Ensure the environment is set up by restoring the dependencies:
   ```r
   renv::restore()
   ```

---

## **Data Setup**

The project requires health data from the World Health Organization (WHO). You can download the necessary datasets from [WHO Health Indicators](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes).

### Data Directory:
- Place the downloaded data in the `data/` folder in the project directory.

If you want to automatically download the data, you can run the following script:
```r
source("scripts/data_download.R")
```

---

## **Code Overview**

The code is structured into separate scripts to make it modular and easier to follow. Below is an overview of each script:

- `scripts/data_download.R`: Downloads and preprocesses the health data.
- `scripts/data_analysis.R`: Performs statistical analysis to determine the impact of urbanization on health outcomes.
- `scripts/visualization.R`: Generates visualizations (e.g., plots) based on the analysis.
- `scripts/main.R`: The main script that runs the entire analysis pipeline, from data loading to generating output.

---

## **Running the Code**

To run the full analysis, execute the `main.R` script, which will call all necessary functions to load data, perform analysis, and generate results. Here's how to run it:

1. Open RStudio and set your working directory to the project folder:
   ```r
   setwd("path/to/urbanization-health-analysis")
   ```

2. Run the `main.R` script:
   ```r
   source("scripts/main.R")
   ```

### **What the Script Does:**
- Downloads the data if not already available.
- Performs data preprocessing.
- Runs the statistical analysis.
- Generates visualizations.
- Saves the results to the `output/` folder.

---

## **Expected Output**

After running the analysis, you will find the following output files in the `output/` folder:

- `analysis_results.csv`: Contains the results of the statistical analysis, including model coefficients and p-values.
- `urban_health_plot.png`: A plot showing the relationship between urbanization and health outcomes.
- `summary_statistics.csv`: A summary of the data used in the analysis.

### **Sample Output:**
- The `analysis_results.csv` might look like:
  ```csv
  Region,Urbanization_Index,Health_Index,Coefficient,P-value
  Africa,0.45,75,0.23,0.001
  Asia,0.65,70,0.19,0.005
  ```

---

## **Troubleshooting**

### **1. Error when loading data**
- **Solution**: Ensure that the data files are located in the `data/` folder. If not, run `source("scripts/data_download.R")` to download them.

### **2. Missing packages**
- **Solution**: Run `renv::restore()` to install any missing packages. Make sure you're in the correct working directory when running the command.

### **3. Graph not displaying**
- **Solution**: If using RStudio, ensure the plotting window is active. Alternatively, you can save the plots to files by modifying the `ggsave()` function calls in `scripts/visualization.R`.
